Inspired by #66DaysofData Campaign started by Ken Jee, I have started to work on #100Days_of_Code challenge to improve my data science skills, learn new concepts and best practices.  
I worked on SQL for some years and then started with my MS Program in Business Analytics. During my MS program, I learnt lot of concepts from Basic statistics to Advance Analytics from awesome Professors. In order to refresh those concepts and learn best practices from the Data Science Gurus, I plan to study from books by great and inspiring authors. This challenge would help me with structured and continous learning.

**Books:**
- A Whirlwind Tour of Python - Jake VanderPlas
- Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython - Wes McKinney
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems - Aurelien Geron
- Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python - Andrew Bruce, Peter C. Bruce, and Peter Gedeck
- Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data - Jake VanderPlas

I will share my Jupyter notebooks, data files, scripts on github.  

I love reading different data science articles and use cases. I will add the links to those articles which can be helpful for others on their learning journey.
