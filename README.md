Inspired by #66DaysofData Campaign started by Ken Jee, I have started to work on #100Days_of_Code challenge to improve my data science concepts and learn some of the best practices. I worked on SQL for some years and then started with my MS Program in Business Analytics. Learnt lot of concepts from Basic statistics to Advance Analytics from awesome Professors. In order to refresh those concepts and learn best practices from the Data Science Gurus, I plan to study from below books:

**Books:**
- A Whirlwind Tour of Python - Jake VanderPlas
- Python for Data Analysis Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_2nd Edition
- Practical Statistics for Data Scientists_2nd Edition
- Python Data Science Handbook - Jake VanderPlas

I will link my Jupyter notebooks, data files, scripts. I love reading different data science articles and use cases. I will add the links here to refer and help others to learn from these articles.
